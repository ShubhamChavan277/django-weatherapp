Welcome, you are in a static text file! 

A static file is a file that does not change when someone visits your site.
It is stored in your Django projectâ€™s 'static' folder and sent to the browser exactly as it is.

Static files can include: 
Images/videos used in your project
CSS/JS files used for your project
Any text file, PDF or other resource you want to share as-is


How to access static files:
1. In 'settings.py' make sure you have included:
STATICFILES_DIRS = [ 
    BASE_DIR / "static", 
]

2. Run your development server (python manage.py runserver).

3. Write the following url in your browser: 
https://127.0.0.1:8000/static/staticfile.txt
